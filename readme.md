# Computational Camera X

For a computational imaging system, computational approaches will normally be
involved in the optical design process. Current optical design software packages are
oriented from the perspective of pure optical design. However, there are other fac-
tors that effect the performance of the whole imaging system, such as image sensor
characteristics, processing algorithms. To allow computational imaging researchers
to rapidly evaluate system performance from different perspectives, our goal is to establish a computational camera simulation framework. In our work, we use both forward and backward raytracing approaches to study the computational imaging system as shown below.

### Sampling Pattern
One example is shown here is our work is able to test the effects of sampling patterns at the entrance pupil.

### Spatial Frequency Response
Another example is shown here is how we determine the SFR results for both the conventional camera and the lenslet based light field camera.
